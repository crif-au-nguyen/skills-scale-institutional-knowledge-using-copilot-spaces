# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management framework! This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to how we plan, execute, and deliver cross-functional projects that create value for our customers and stakeholders.

## Overview

At OctoAcme, we follow a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery. Our framework is built on five core principles: prioritizing customer value and usability, delivering small testable increments, establishing clear ownership for every project, making data-informed decisions based on measurable impact, and fostering psychological safety to encourage feedback and continuous learning. Each project is led by a dedicated Project Manager who coordinates delivery and manages risks, working closely with a Product Manager who defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog. Our delivery teams include developers who implement features, QA specialists who validate quality, and stakeholders who provide guidance and approvals.

Our project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible approach across five key phases. Projects begin with **Initiation**, where we validate business needs, align stakeholders, and create a project one-pager that defines the problem, goals, and success metrics. During **Planning**, we break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks, and create a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria. The **Execution** phase involves daily standups, weekly syncs, and continuous integration with automated testing and code reviews. We maintain transparency through project boards tracking work from backlog to done, with pull requests that include issue links and require peer approval. When features are ready, we move to **Release**, deploying through automated pipelines with comprehensive smoke tests and rollback plans. Finally, we **Close and Retrospect**, capturing learnings and converting them into actionable improvements for future projects.

Communication and quality assurance are embedded throughout our processes. Teams maintain a regular cadence of twice-weekly standups, weekly PM-PdM syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates, with ad-hoc escalations when needed. We track risks in a living risk register, updating impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies at weekly syncs. Our quality practices include unit and integration testing, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI/CD pipelines, and manual QA validation for feature acceptance. We emphasize small pull requests (preferably under 400 lines), comprehensive test coverage, and continuous monitoring of success metrics identified in project charters.

The personas and documentation below provide detailed guidance for each phase and role. New team members should start with the Project Management Overview, then explore role-specific guides relevant to their responsibilities. Project leads should maintain key artifacts like project charters, risk registers, and retrospective action items in project repositories, with process documentation added to `.copilot/` directories for AI-assisted context and guidance.
